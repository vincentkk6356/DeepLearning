What is a Neural Network?
In the nueral network combines Xs to be new features and connects the new features to output Y.
Given the input Xs and output Ys, the middle features are generated/figured out.

What is Supervised Learning?
Given input and output to train. Types: Standard NN, CNN (image data), RNN (sequence data), Hybrid

Structured Data: Each of the feature has a well defined meaning, Database data
Unstructured Data: Audio, Image, Text
